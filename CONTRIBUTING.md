I have a full time job and I don't get paid to offer customer support for this package :) If you have problems, please make an attempt at fixing and improving the code, and raise a pull request. If you still can't solve your problem then raise an issue, but please ensure that you include as much information as possible. Reports of 'It doesn't work' don't help the community.
